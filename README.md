a predecessor to the late movie-web.

## philosophy
"culture shouldn't exist only for those who can afford it."

## features
- automatic saving of progress - optionally synced to an account.
- bookmark shows or movies, keep track of what you want to watch.
- minimalistic interface that only shows whats required - no algorithm to consume you.
- no ads! - enjoy ad free content watching.

## extension
due to the removal of the extension from both chromium and firefox the extension must now be installed locally. <br>
